Feature: transliteration
  As a user
  I want to be able to transliterate latin characters into nepali characters
  So, I can search using latin characters

  Background:
    Given the user has browsed to the homepage

  Scenario: nepali string transliteration for the entered english character term should be displayed
    When the user enters the string "munaa madan" into the main search field
    Then the transliteration should be "मुना मदन्"

  Scenario: nepali string transliteration for the entered nepali character term should not be displayed
    When the user enters the string "मुना मदन्" into the main search field
    Then the transliteration should not be displayed
